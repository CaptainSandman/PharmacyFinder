# PharmacyFinder app #

This is an application made for a coding assessment for a job I applied for at Rx Savings Solutions. (PS: They didn't hire me. :cry:)

I decided to use ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend because it's new to me and thought it'd be fun to try out.

I decided to use Vue.js for the frontend because I'm familiar with it and I like it a lot. :)

Live demo (front-end hosted on Amazon S3, but I'm too cheap and lazy for back-end hosting): https://pharmacy-finder.machonacho.io/
