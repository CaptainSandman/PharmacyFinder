# PharmacyFinder app #

This is an application made for a coding assessment for a job I applied for.

I decided to use ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend because it's new to me and thought it'd be fun to try out.

I decided to use Vue.js for the frontend because I'm familiar with it and I like it a lot. :)
